What is "Others" Expenditure Type?
"Others" is a Default Expenditure Type. It is used by the App for its Internal Purposes. Whenever you make an expenditure, if it does not belong to any of the Expenditure Types you have set, you can add the Expenditure in this Type. Since you can never define all types of Expenditures you will make, its advised to have this Field. Later sometime, if you delete an Expenditure Type, all Expenditures associated with that Expenditure Type will be transferred to "Others" Expenditure Type. So, editing this field may interfere with the App and you may find Unexpected behaviour of App. If you don't know what you are doing, Please DON'T Edit this Expenditure Type.
